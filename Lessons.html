                            of problems. It's a language that helps us describe and figure things out. Imagine you have a bunch of things,
                             like toys or fruits, and you want to organize them or share them equally with friends. 
                             That's where basic math, like counting and dividing, comes in handy.
                        </h3>
                       <h3 style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px; ">As time went on, people started using math to answer more complex questions. 
                        For example, how planets move in the sky or how to build really strong structures like bridges. 
                        The ancient Greeks and others played a big role in figuring out the rules for shapes and numbers.</h3>
                        <h3 style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; ">Jump ahead to more recent times, and you've got famous mathematicians like Newton and Leibniz. 
                            They gave us powerful tools like calculus, which helps us understand things like 
                            how objects move or change.</h3>
                        <h3 style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 30px; ">But math isn't just about numbers. It's a way of thinking and solving problems. In today's world, math is 
                            everywhere, from computer science to figuring out the best deals at the store. It's like a super 
                            useful set of tools that helps us make sense of the world.</h3>

  				<li>A. What is a function?</li>
  				<li>B. Evaluating a function</li>

                    	<h3>A. What is a Function?</h3>
                    	<ul type="A">
  				<li>● A function is a rule that assigns to each object in a set A exactly one object in a set B. The set A is called the domain of the 						function, and the set of assigned objects in B is called the range.</li>
  				<li>● A function is denoted as f(x) and read as "f of x" not "f multiplied by x".</li>                
                    	</ul>
                    	<h3>B. Evaluating a function</h3>
                    	<p>
                    		<b><u>1. What is the domain of the function <i>f(2) = x + 5:</i></u></b><br><br>
                    		Answer: 2. The domain of the function is equal to the value of x and is also the input to the function.<br><br>
                    		<b><u>2. Evaluate the function <i>f(2) = x + 5:</i></u></b><br><br>
				Answer: 7. To find the value of a function, we have to identify the domain and then process the input value by substituting the 				variable x in the process.
                    	</p>
                    	<h3>C. Who uses functions and what are they used for?</h3>
                    	<ul type="A">
  				<li>● Computer engineers use functions to design computer systems.</li>
  				<li>● Programmers use functions to implement their code.</li>    
  				<li>● Business managers use functions to compute for the price of a product.</li>
  				<li>● Economists use functions to study the population.</li>
